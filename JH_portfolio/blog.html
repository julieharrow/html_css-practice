    <h3>plays nice with ruby</h3>
    <p>
      I never really liked to be called 'Jule' when I was younger.  For some reason, it reminded me of fake jewels and bedazzled accessories from the 90s.  But as I reflect on my newly developed infatuation with Ruby (the coding language, not the gem), I can't help but feel like I should have given the nickname more of a chance...
    </p>
    <p>
      My coding journey began over {system.out.print(concat(integer.toString(currentYear - 2007),"years ago"));}.  And yes, the reference to system.out.print means to suggest that it all started with Java.  When I was 16 years old, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into MIT's <a href="http://wtp.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Women's Technology Program</a> - a month long nerd camp of sorts where 40 teenage girls from all of the world gathered to learn electrical engineering and computer science from MIT masters students.  Before that summer, I had never even heard of 'computer programming' - honestly, I thought that MIT was going to teach me to build a calculator.  I suppose that was partially true.  But what's really funning about that story is that, when I returned to my small town high school after that summer, I student taught the very first computer programming class at my school and showed everyone how to make a calculator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skip forward and I actually end up going to MIT for undergrad and I declare my major in computer science.  Now you are thinking, <i>wait - then why would you later attend a coding bootcamp?</i>  Well you see, in my very limited sphere of knowledge as a college freshman, I had the misguided opinion that coding was not a creative outlet of expression.  I know!  I could not have been more wrong.  But you have to give me some credit - web development was in its infancy at the time and the only real world stories of coding that I'd been exposed to in college were those of my older, male professors.  So sadly, I deviated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explored architecture and ultimately earned a degree in civil engineering - a degree type that was extremely sought after in the management consulting world. It was no surprise that I wound up in a consulting firm upon graduation.  I worked with many different types of clients and on one project, I actually built a mini program in excel to help the quality-control division of a food manufacturing plant calculate the statistical variance in the weights of waste-product.  I had to build this program so that it was simple enough to be used by individuals who had never once used a computer.  Simply said, that task <b>inspired</b> me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized then that I <b>loved</b> the idea of being able to make others' lives easier through tools that I build...and I was addicted.  I moved on from consulting and into an education non-profit, as the "Associate of Systems and Data."  One thing you learn quickly at a non-profit is that all hands are on deck.  So, my hands got to play in everything!  I built more tools in excel to handle some data-crunching; I built custom workflows in our CRM to increase efficiency for the staff; and I even designed a custom web-portal for the users of our products.
    </p>
    <p>
      How foolish I'd been to ever think that coding wasn't a creative outlet.  So I made the decision to switch fully back into computer science, but I'd need a major refresher - hence the bootcamp.  For the first time in a long time, I am pursuing exactly what I want to and I have all the evidence I need to support the fact that this is exactly what I am meant to be doing. And that feels <i>nice</i>.

    <h4 class="timeline">week 1 : day 1</h4>
    <p>
      Today I have started my first day as a student of the Tech Talent South immersive coding bootcamp and we will be learning <b> Ruby </b>, in addition, of course, to things like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and also Rails, SaaS, etc.  Over the last few weeks, I completed all of the prework, coded every example, and now I am just anxious to learn everything about how to design, build, refine, and launch my very own programs!  Even as the teacher talked through the syllabus, I felt SO anxious to be building.  We went through the basics and then were asked to build a very basic "hello world" type HTML page for homework.  Well, 8 hours after class and I couldn't stop trying to enhance my site.  I was googling like no other to learn all the new techniques that I could grasp. Can't wait for day 2.
    <h4 class="timeline">week 1 : day 2</h4>
    <p>
      I think a lot of my past coding experience is more front of mind than I initially realized.  Things are going well and I am taking advantage of the teacher's experience to understand ways that professionals in this industry find efficiency through shortcuts and best-practices.  I can feel my curiosity being fueled by the knowledge I've gained - like with each new learning, I am thirsty to build more, search more, try more.
